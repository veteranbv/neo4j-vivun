# Other Graph Databases That Could Do This On CDP

Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) is a big data platform that primarily focuses on data processing and analysis using Hadoop and related technologies, such as Apache Spark and Apache Hive. While CDP does not have a built-in graph database, you can integrate some graph databases or graph processing frameworks with CDP to perform graph analysis. Here are a few options:

1. **Apache TinkerPop and JanusGraph:** Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework that can work with various graph databases. JanusGraph is an open-source, distributed graph database that is compatible with TinkerPop. You can store JanusGraph data in HBase or Cassandra, which can be integrated with the Cloudera Data Platform.

2. **Neo4j with Hadoop Connector:** Although Neo4j is not natively integrated with CDP, you can use the Neo4j-Hadoop connector to interact with Hadoop HDFS for reading and writing data. This approach allows you to use Neo4j for graph processing while leveraging HDFS as the data storage layer.

3. **Apache Giraph:** Apache Giraph is a graph processing framework built on top of Apache Hadoop. While not a graph database, Giraph can be used to perform large-scale graph processing tasks using the Hadoop infrastructure. This is especially useful if you need to perform graph analytics and computations on massive graphs.

4. **GraphX on Apache Spark:** GraphX is a graph processing library built on top of Apache Spark. Although not a graph database, it provides graph computation capabilities and can process graph data stored in HDFS or other compatible storage systems. This can be a good choice if you are already using Spark for big data processing within CDP.

Each of these options has its own advantages and trade-offs. Depending on your specific requirements, you can choose the one that best fits your needs in terms of scalability, integration with CDP, and the ability to perform graph analytics and processing tasks.

## Apache TinkerPop and JanusGraph

To perform the suggested analysis using Apache TinkerPop and JanusGraph, you'll need to set up JanusGraph, load your data into the graph, and then use Gremlin (TinkerPop's graph traversal language) to query the data.

Here's an outline of the steps:

1. **Set up JanusGraph:** First, you need to download and set up JanusGraph. Follow the instructions in the JanusGraph documentation to get started: <https://docs.janusgraph.org/basics/getting-started/>

2. **Configure JanusGraph storage backend:** JanusGraph can use various storage backends, such as Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, or Google Cloud Bigtable. You can find instructions on configuring the storage backend in the JanusGraph documentation: <https://docs.janusgraph.org/storage-backend/>

3. **Load data into JanusGraph:** Once JanusGraph is set up, you'll need to load your product gap and customer data into the graph. The following Gremlin script demonstrates how to load data from a CSV file:

    ```groovy
    graph = JanusGraphFactory.open("path/to/your/janusgraph-config.properties")
    g = graph.traversal()

    new File("path/to/your/product_gaps_customers.csv").eachLine { line ->
    def parts = line.split(",")
    def gapId = parts[0].toLong()
    def gapName = parts[1]
    def customerId = parts[2].toLong()
    def customerName = parts[3]
    def revenue = parts[4].toDouble()

    def gap = g.V().hasLabel("ProductGap").has("id", gapId).tryNext().orElseGet {
        g.addV("ProductGap").property("id", gapId).property("name", gapName).next()
    }
    def customer = g.V().hasLabel("Customer").has("id", customerId).tryNext().orElseGet {
        g.addV("Customer").property("id", customerId).property("name", customerName).next()
    }
    g.addE("AFFECTED_BY").from(customer).to(gap).property("revenue", revenue).iterate()
    }

    graph.tx().commit()
    ```

    This script reads the CSV file and creates `ProductGap` and `Customer` vertices, along with the `AFFECTED_BY` edges, in JanusGraph.

4. **Perform the analysis using Gremlin:** With the data loaded into JanusGraph, you can now perform the suggested analysis using Gremlin. The following Gremlin query calculates the weighted score for each product gap, considering the impacted revenue, the number of customers affected, and the average number of additional gaps affecting those customers:

    ```groovy
    g.V().hasLabel("ProductGap").
    project("gap", "totalRevenue", "customersCount", "avgAdditionalGaps", "weightedScore").
        by(valueMap()).
        by(inE("AFFECTED_BY").values("revenue").sum()).
        by(inE("AFFECTED_BY").count()).
        by(inE("AFFECTED_BY").outV().outE("AFFECTED_BY").inV().where(neq("self")).dedup().count().mean()).
    order().by(select("weightedScore").by(divide(multiply(local(select("totalRevenue")), local(select("customersCount"))), add(local(select("avgAdditionalGaps")), constant(1)))), decr)
    ```

    This query returns a sorted list of product gaps based on the weighted score, considering the impacted revenue, the number of customers affected, and the average number of additional gaps affecting those customers.

By following these steps, you should be able to use Apache TinkerPop and Janus Graph to perform the suggested analysis.
